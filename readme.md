What is MoreRealistic Mod ?
A deep modification of the game to make it enjoyable for me (especially the driving experience since I want the game to be a "driving farming simulator") 

MoreRealistic history :
IRL, I drove my first tractor at the age of 7 (only the steering wheel, Ford 7000 and IH745)
I am also a software engineer (but not only)
I discovered and played LS2009 just before Farming Simulator 2011 was released
I started modding with FS2011 -> the game physics was too bad (unrealistic flying tractor. The more weight on the wheels, the more power you get, no rolling resistance, etc etc)
So, I created MR11 to get the best driving experience from the vanilla game (and fix many bugs like the farm bales elevator). Once FS2011 with MR was feeling great to me, I released MR11.
But it was a bit late : Farming Simulator 2013 was released too, it took me "ages" to make MR11 (thousands hours).
Then, I worked on MR13 because vanilla FS2013 was feeling so bad compared to MR11. Another time, it took me a bunch of time to get the "MR engien" ready, and then, I had to convert every piece of equipement to be "MR"... And then expansion vehicles...
And so, I spent another couple of thousand hours on this one.
When FS15 was released, I gave it a try : still not good, I could not feel I was driving a tractor. I check what could be done with modding, but didn't achieve to do anything good (didn't even achieve to apply proper gravity) => so no MR15
When FS17 was released, it feeled the same. As usual, it was like playing with "playmobil" tractors. I achieve to make MR17 and spent a lot of time to convert vehicles. Of course, there were even more vehicles than before = I guess I spent the most time on this one (more than 3000 hours ?)
At the end = I spent all my free time to this mod, but did not have time to enjoy the game with it...
Then, FS19 was released => I had a new job, and no time for playing (more than full-time job = 3000 hours per year). So, no MR
The same for FS22 => same job and still no time for FS or MR.



Why MR25 ?
I bought the game just before release, 

What can you expect from MoreRealistic ?
* rolling resistance (something not present in base game engine, but really, really, really important IRL for farming vehicles)
* better tire forces (example : no more possible to pull more than your weight)
* earth gravity (this was not the case in FS2011 and 2013)
* IRL mass (realistic fillType density, no mass limit, better center of mass)
* MoreRealistic harvest and working speed (still a bit "easy" compared to IRL, but you will want that high horse power shinny tractor or bigger combine now.)
* Engine with proper torque curve (try to compare John Deere 3650 and Landini REX4 120 with or without MR, at work in a hilly field)



Funfact01 : I bought the game on Steam first. And then, I had to buy it directly from Giants because modding is not welcome on the steam version of the game... (no lua game source)
Funfact02 : Each MoreRealistic project is started from scratch. I do not copy code from previous game.
Funfact03 : it can take me dozens of hours (hundred ?) to remove some unwanted vanilla features that would take Giants minutes to remove (say hello FS20111 "damping" value)
Funfact04 : it seems every piece of equipement I look at is "wrong" (maybe I look too much ?) : APE50 is not CVT driven IRL, Aprilia 125 is not 100Hp at all IRL (especially the current 4 strokes engine), Landini REX4 is not a GT version (this is a F version in game) , Amazone Spreader is not a 3200 model (this is the 2600 version : not the same width at all, GreatPlains 1500 has the wrong optionnal attachment : this is not a fertilizer unit ! this is the small seeds attachement unit, Challenger MT635/645 and MT655/665 = not the same engine ! sisu 7.4L and 8.4L / not the same transmission : funk 18/6 and 18/9)
FunFact05 : in base game, more than 90% of vehicles share the same engine (same torque curve, just a factor applied to derate the power). You can't feel the difference between a 8.4L valmet engine and a 3.6L deutz engine => this is not a wanted experience for a driving simulator, especially with manual gears
