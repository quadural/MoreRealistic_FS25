        This file allows us to override the base game yield => litersPerHa = max yield possible with fertilizer, ploughing, etc

        Then, we can describe how "hard" each fruit is to be hearvested compared to WHEAT
        No value in this file for a fruit means the "mr engine" will use WHEAT data (except for yield)

        all values are based on base fruit = WHEAT
            that's means WHEAT = 1 for all values

        all values are based on volume (liters), not mass (tons)
            that means we have to think in "how many trailers" rather than "how many tons"

        capacityFx => allow us to specify if this fruit can limit combine by "capacity" (liter of grain per hour : because of grain size or shape, because of air fan or sieves unit or returns)
            harvesting some fruit too fast means loss, broken grain or plugged combine IRL
            value of 1 means this is like WHEAT (as much trailer per hour than harvesting WHEAT)
            example : canola "grain" is very small, and so, a combine harvester elevator can't lift as much liter per hour of this grain compared to WHEAT (each elevator's pallet is less filled at max capacity) // / we can't use full fan speed otherwise, smaller grain are ejected from the combine
            if we want the same capacity than wheat, formula would be : 1*(fruit liters per ha) / (wheat liters per ha)

        threshingFx => value of 1 means we are threshing WHEAT
            if the fruit is harder to thresh (conveyor, main drum, accelerator, rotor) for the harvester, we can set a higher value (this is a factor => 1.25 means 25% more power required to process the same liter per hour than for wheat)

        chopperFx => value of 1 means about 1KW per Ton per hour to add to the "mrCombineChopperIdlePower" while harvesting (default value for WHEAT)
            if the stems are easier to chop than wheat straw, we can set a lower value (factor to apply to the chopper)
            value of 1 means that if we are harvesting as much liters per hour than in WHEAT, the chopper power will be the same as for WHEAT.
