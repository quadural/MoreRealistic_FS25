        this is not a 3200 model
        it looks like a 2600 model, year 2017

        3200 model = "L" (large, 2.72m wide for loading)
        2600 model = "S" (Small, 2.23m wide for loading)

        since the decals says 3200, let's pretend this is a 3200

        => 573kg empty weight, without option
        => option parking rollers
        => option hydro

        650kg/min maxi
        30kph maxi

        if we were spreading high dosage (talking of nitrate fertilizer here, max dosage in one pass is something like 500kg/Ha) => we would be limited by speed => 30kph and 42m wide = 126Ha/Hour => 2.1Ha/min = 1050kg/min
        ingame = 280L/min @18kph and 42m wide => about 222L/ha, so we can spread @30kph => 466L/min (less than 500kg/min)
        but, maybe the dosage can vary from one map to another, and so, we are limiting the speed as if we were spreading max dosage (500kg/ha)
        Nearly nobody spread @30kph anyway
        => 650kg/min maxi and 500kg/ha => 1.3ha/minute maxi => 18.5kph
        => so, ok with base game speed limit of 18kph

        to be more realistic, we would have to set a max kilos per min value for each spreader, and then apply a specific weight to each solid fertilizer and then check the spreading rate (dosage) for our field (how many kilos per hectare needed)
        so, since there is only one solid fertilizer ingame, we can keep a fixed value for the speed limit, even if it should also depend on the spreading width ... and the wind speed :-)
